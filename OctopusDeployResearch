# Octopus Deploy

**Octopus Deploy** is an automated deployment and release management tool.

Automated deployment
Automated build servers like Jenkins, TeamCity, and Team Build are designed to enable the practice of continuous integration. They do this by providing a single place to verify that the code a developer has committed compiles, that unit tests pass, and that it's safe for other developers to merge their changes. Practically speaking, they also settle the age-old "it builds on my machine" debate.
Deploying software is different to building it:
●	A build server runs an entire build sequentially on a single agent. There are usually many servers involved in a deployment, and some deployment steps need to happen in parallel.
●	Builds embrace the "fail fast" principle. If a problem is encountered during a deployment, we often want to manually intervene, or skip the broken step and proceed with the rest of the deployment.
●	Build server permission & auditing models aren't usually designed for release management.
The best engineering teams recognize that build and deployment are fundamentally different. There are some similarities - they both involve automation - but the architecture of a robust deployment system is simply different to that of a build server.
